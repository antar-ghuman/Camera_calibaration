# Camera Calibaration

Calibrated the camera using the checkboard method for computer vision tasks to get the relation between 3D world point and 2D image point. Found the 32 2D image coordinates of the checkboard corners, calculated the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (projection matrix) of the camera.
